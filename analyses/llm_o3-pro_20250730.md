## Technical Details

- **Architecture Insights:**  
  - No architectural specifics or parameter counts are provided in the core dataset.  
  - Indirect information suggests high model complexity given latency and task focus on reasoning, but no direct data on transformer size or innovations is present.

- **Input/Output Specifications:**  
  - Median output tokens per second is ~20.256, indicating a moderate generation speed.  
  - Median time to first token is roughly 115.7 seconds, which suggests a trade-off favoring accuracy and reasoning depth over latency.  
  - Token pricing differentiates input and output tokens, indicating token-based API interaction.

## Pricing & Availability

- **Cost Structure and Pricing Tiers:**  
  - Blended 3-to-1 token pricing: $35 per 1 million tokens (blended ratio of 3 input tokens per output token presumably).  
  - Input tokens: $20 per 1 million tokens  
  - Output tokens: $80 per 1 million tokens  
  - Pricing reflects a premium model, consistent with professional-grade capabilities and slower output.  

- **Availability and Access Methods:**  
  - Released on June 10, 2025  
  - Available via OpenAIâs platform (details about specific access such as API tiers or subscription plans not explicitly provided)  
  - No explicit mention of platform access (ChatGPT Pro, Team, or API) in the data

## Use Cases & Applications

- **Recommended Applications (inferred from performance and data):**  
  - Complex reasoning tasks requiring stepwise logic within professional or scientific domains  
  - Advanced coding and debugging assistance indicated by benchmark relevance (e.g., GPQA related to professional question answering)  
  - Tasks benefiting from high accuracy and domain expertise, considering its AI intelligence index and GPQA score

- **Strengths:**  
  - High reasoning capability as suggested by AI intelligence index of 71 and GPQA of 0.845  
  - Suitable for tasks with significant accuracy and correctness requirements  
  - Strong output token throughput (20.256 tokens/sec), though initial latency is high  

- **Limitations:**  
  - High median time to first token (115+ seconds) indicates slower response times, which may be a bottleneck in real-time or latency-sensitive applications  
  - Limited benchmark data available; domain-specific strengths and weaknesses cannot be fully determined from the provided data alone

# Summary

The **o3-pro** by OpenAI is a premium advanced reasoning AI model launched in June 2025, specialized for complex reasoning tasks with an emphasis on accuracy over raw speed. Key quantified strengths include an AI intelligence index of 71.0 and a GPQA score of 0.845, alongside a moderate token output rate of ~20.3 tokens per second. Its long median time to first token (~115 seconds) reflects computational intensity likely due to stepwise reasoning processes.

Pricing positions o3-pro as a high-end solution with distinct charges for input and output tokens, suited for professional environments seeking reliable and deep analysis in STEM, coding, finance, and business applications. However, the lack of detailed architecture data, limited benchmark coverage, and absence of explicit community feedback in the dataset constrain deeper comparative analysis.

Overall, based on the supplied data, o3-pro appears to be a high-accuracy, reasoning-focused AI model with a premium cost profile and suitable for knowledge-work tasks where depth of reasoning outweighs latency concerns.
