Null values exist for AIME, MATH_500, indicating incomplete evaluation on certain advanced math benchmarks.

Comparisons within the provided datasets show Grok Code Fast 1 performing competitively among xAI models and coding specialists. It outperforms older xAI entries like Grok-1 (which has null evaluations across most metrics) in available benchmarks. Against OpenAI's coding-focused models, it lags in specialized coding indices (e.g., vs. GPT-5 Codex's 53.5 coding index) but matches or exceeds in speed and tool-use (Tau2). In the broader LLMs dataset, it sits mid-tier for intelligence and math but excels in MMLU Pro relative to Meta's Llama variants (e.g., Llama 3.3 Instruct 70B at 0.713). The OpenRouter Catalogue highlights xAI's Grok models for large context (up to 2M tokens in Grok 4 Fast), suggesting Grok Code Fast 1 benefits from similar architectural efficiencies for coding agents.

## Technical Details

Architectural insights are limited in the data, but Grok Code Fast 1 employs a text-to-text architecture with a Grok tokenizer, supporting parameters like include_reasoning, max_tokens, reasoning (for enabling hybrid reasoning modes), response_format, seed, stop, structured_outputs, temperature, tool_choice, tools, top_logprobs, and top_p. It features visible reasoning traces in responses, allowing control via the `reasoning` parameter for agentic steeringâideal for coding workflows where internal thought processes aid debugging or planning. Input specifications include text-only prompts up to 256,000 tokens context, with max completion tokens of 10,000. Output is text-based, optimized for code generation, tool calling, and structured responses (e.g., JSON). No explicit details on parameter count or training data are provided, but its focus on "agentic coding" implies post-training for tool integration and reasoning efficiency. Median latency metrics (time to first token: 8.681s) suggest it's tuned for production speed, with input cache read pricing indicating potential optimization for repeated contexts.

Information on underlying layers, MoE structure, or precise training methodology is not present in the datasets.

## Pricing & Availability

Pricing follows a per-token model, with input at $0.20 per million tokens and output at $1.50 per million tokens (blended 3:1 ratio: $0.525 per million). In OpenRouter terms, this equates to $0.0000002 per input token and $0.0000015 per output token, plus $0.00000002 per input cache read unitâpositioning it as economical for high-volume coding tasks. No request, image, web search, or internal reasoning fees are listed, keeping costs low for text-only workflows.

Availability is through OpenRouter (slug: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1), where it is accessible via API with no moderation (is_moderated: false). It supports per-request limits (none specified) and is listed in the OpenRouter Catalogue alongside other xAI models like Grok 4 Fast, indicating broad integration for developers. No on-premise or free tiers are mentioned in the data; access requires an OpenRouter account. The model's free usage note for prompts/completions improving future xAI models applies to variants like Grok 4 Fast, but not explicitly to this one.

## Use Cases & Applications

Based on benchmarks, Grok Code Fast 1 is recommended for agentic coding applications, such as autonomous code generation, debugging, refactoring, and tool-integrated development workflows (strong Tau2: 0.757 and LiveCodeBench: 0.657). It suits software engineering tasks requiring reasoning traces for transparency, like building projects from specs or integrating tools (e.g., via supported parameters for tool_choice and tools). High MMLU Pro (0.793) and GPQA (0.727) make it viable for knowledge-intensive coding, such as scientific computing or math-related scripts, while its speed (266 tokens/s) supports real-time IDE plugins or CI/CD pipelines.

Strengths include economical pricing for fast, reasoning-enabled code synthesis and long-context handling (256k tokens) for large codebases. It excels in instruction-following (IFBench: 0.414) and general intelligence (48.6 index), outperforming smaller models in agentic scenarios.

Limitations: Lower scores in hard terminal tasks (0.163) suggest challenges with low-level system interactions; moderate math (43.3 index) may limit advanced algorithmic coding without additional prompting. Null evaluations on AIME and MATH_500 indicate gaps in pure math prowess compared to specialists like GPT-5 Codex. No multimodal support (text-only) restricts vision-based coding (e.g., UI from images).

## Community & Updates

Grok Code Fast 1 was released on 2025-08-28, shortly after other xAI models in the OpenRouter Catalogue (e.g., Grok 4 Fast), reflecting xAI's rapid iteration on Grok-series models with a focus on efficiency and context length (up to 2M in siblings). The structured dataset highlights xAI's trend toward long-context, reasoning-enabled models, with this variant emphasizing coding specializationâlikely an update addressing agentic needs post-Grok-1's limited evaluations.

No user feedback, adoption metrics, or community discussions are present in the provided datasets. The OpenRouter description notes its role in high-quality coding workflows, but no explicit updates beyond the release date are detailed. As part of xAI's ecosystem, it aligns with broader trends in the LLMs dataset toward hybrid reasoning (e.g., visible traces), suggesting ongoing development for tool-use and speed optimizations.

It represents the first flagship non-thinking model in the Ling 2.0 series, built around a sparse-activation architecture with roughly 50 billion active parameters per token. The model supports up to 128 K tokens of context and emphasizes efficient reasoning through an “Evolutionary Chain-of-Thought (Evo-CoT)” training strategy.\n\nPre-trained on more than 20 trillion reasoning-dense tokens, Ling-1T achieves strong results across code generation, mathematics, and logical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency. It employs FP8 mixed-precision training, MoE routing with QK normalization, and MTP layers for compositional reasoning stability. The model also introduces LPO (Linguistics-unit Policy Optimization) for post-training alignment, enhancing sentence-level semantic control.\n\nLing-1T can perform complex text generation, multilingual reasoning, and front-end code synthesis with a focus on both functionality and aesthetics.",

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.\n\nIn internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.\n",

It introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining output quality. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model was trained under conditions aligned with V3.1-Terminus to enable direct comparison. Benchmarking shows performance roughly on par with V3.1 across reasoning, coding, and agentic tool-use tasks, with minor tradeoffs and gains depending on the domain. This release focuses on validating architectural optimizations for extended context lengths rather than advancing raw task accuracy, making it primarily a research-oriented model for exploring efficient transformer designs.",

It is designed for both interactive development sessions and long, independent execution of complex engineering tasks. The model supports building projects from scratch, feature development, debugging, large-scale refactoring, and code review. Compared to GPT-5, Codex is more steerable, adheres closely to developer instructions, and produces cleaner, higher-quality code outputs. Reasoning effort can be adjusted with the `reasoning.effort` parameter. Read the [docs here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#reasoning-effort-level)\n\nCodex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup. Codex is intended specifically for agentic coding applications.",

It is a large hybrid reasoning model (671B parameters, 37B active) that supports both thinking and non-thinking modes. It extends the DeepSeek-V3 base with a two-phase long-context training process, reaching up to 128K tokens, and uses FP8 microscaling for efficient inference. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model improves tool use, code generation, and reasoning efficiency, achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 on difficult benchmarks while responding more quickly.
