| Median Time to First Token (s) | 137.643        | 13.748        | 13.724        | 40.072         |
| Price 1M blended (3:1 input/output) | $35           | $35           | Not listed    | Not listed     |

- The **o3-pro** stands out with its significantly higher GPQA score relative to the baseline o3 and the "mini" variants, suggesting enhanced reasoning and question-answering quality.  
- However, it is markedly slower in token generation speed and initial response latency, indicating a trade-off favoring depth and accuracy over speed.  
- Pricing for o3-pro is on the higher side compared to baseline models, reflecting its premium capabilities.  
- Other benchmark results such as coding index, math index, or multi-modal-specific performance are not available for o3-pro, limiting full performance comparison.

# Summary

The **OpenAI o3-pro** is an advanced reasoning model emphasizing precision and reliability in complex question answering (GPQA of 0.845) and artificial intelligence reasoning (index 67.5). Compared to other models in the "o3" family, it delivers superior accuracy at a significant cost in latency, with median response start times well above 2 minutes and output token generation speeds about an order of magnitude slower.

Pricing reflects its premium positioning, with output tokens priced at $80 per million, targeting users who prioritize depth of reasoning and accuracy over throughput or latency. While thorough coding and math benchmarks are missing, the modelâs core strength clearly lies in its AI reasoning capabilities.

The model is best suited for research, analysis, and applications where detailed, multi-step, and reliable reasoning is essential and where longer response times and higher cost can be justified. However, incomplete performance benchmarking data and slow runtime characteristics may limit broader adoption for many real-time or cost-sensitive applications.
