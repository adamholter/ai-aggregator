  "analysis": "## Model Overview\n- **Name, Creator, and Category**: The model is named \"Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite Preview 09-2025\", developed by Google (vendor). It belongs to the OpenRouter Catalogue category, which aggregates 17 models featuring a mix of text-only, multimodal (text+image), and specialized coding models. This specific model is a lightweight reasoning variant in the Gemini 2.5 family, categorized under high-end multimodal models with advanced capabilities like reasoning modes and large context windows.\n- **Key Specifications and Capabilities**: It supports a context length of 1,048,576 tokens and a maximum of 65,536 completion tokens. The model is optimized for ultra-low latency and cost efficiency, offering improved throughput and faster token generation compared to earlier Flash models. It handles multimodal inputs including text, images, files, and audio, producing text outputs (modality: text+image->text, with input modalities: file, image, text, audio; output modalities: text). By default, \"thinking\" (multi-pass reasoning) is disabled for speed, but it can be enabled via the Reasoning API parameter to trade off cost for intelligence. It uses the Gemini tokenizer and supports tool use, structured outputs, and parameters like temperature, top_p, and reasoning control. No specific instruct_type is defined. Information on exact parameter counts or training data is not present in the provided datasets.\n\n## Performance Analysis\n- **Benchmarks and Scores**: Specific benchmark scores are not detailed in the provided data for this model. The description notes \"better performance across common benchmarks compared to earlier Flash models,\" with emphasis on reasoning, but no numerical metrics (e.g., MMLU, GPQA, or coding benchmarks) are provided.\n- **Comparisons with Similar Models**: Within the OpenRouter Catalogue, it is compared to other Gemini variants like \"Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 09-2025,\" which shares the same 1,048,576 token context length but has a higher prompt price (0.0000003 vs. 0.0000001) and supports configurable \"max tokens for reasoning.\" This Lite version is positioned as more efficient for low-latency tasks. Broader highlights mention it alongside models like xAI's Grok 4 Fast (2M context, non-reasoning/reasoning flavors) and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 (1M context, optimized for agents/coding), noting Gemini 2.5 Flash models' support for image input and large contexts. It contrasts with heavier models like Qwen3 VL 235B A22B Thinking (262,144 context, multimodal reasoning) by prioritizing speed over depth. No direct head-to-head scores are available in the datasets.\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Architecture Insights**: The model uses a Gemini tokenizer and is designed as a lightweight reasoning model in the Gemini 2.5 family. It incorporates multimodal fusion for text, images, files, and audio inputs, with default non-reasoning mode for efficiency but optional \"thinking\" via API parameters (e.g., include_reasoning, reasoning). Supported parameters include max_tokens, response_format, seed, stop, structured_outputs, temperature, tool_choice, tools, and top_p, with defaults set to null for temperature, top_p, and frequency_penalty. It is not moderated (is_moderated: false) and has no per-request limits. The Hugging Face ID is empty, indicating no direct open-source release in the data. Detailed architecture (e.g., parameter count, layers, or training specifics) is not present in the provided datasets.\n- **Input/Output Specifications**: Inputs support text, image, file, and audio modalities, with a maximum context of 1,048,576 tokens. Outputs are text-only, up to 65,536 tokens. It enables reasoning control for multi-pass processing when activated, and supports tools for agentic workflows. No details on output modalities beyond text or specific file handling limits are provided.\n\n## Pricing & Availability\n- **Cost Structure and Pricing Tiers**: Pricing is per token: prompt at $0.0000001 (0.0001 per 1,000 tokens), completion at $0.0000004 (0.0004 per 1,000 tokens). Additional costs like image ($0), web_search ($0), and internal_reasoning ($0) are free. No request fees apply. Compared to the catalogue's range ($0.00001 to $0.00012 per thousand tokens for top-tier models), this is among the lowest, aligning with its cost-efficiency focus. Free tiers or caching costs are not mentioned for this model, unlike some free variants (e.g., Tongyi DeepResearch 30B A3B). The catalogue notes varying structures, with some models free for basic use.\n- **Availability and Access Methods**: Available via the OpenRouter platform (display URL: https://openrouter.ai/models/google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025). It is a preview model (created: 1758819686, approximately September 2025 checkpoint). Access is through API with supported parameters; no per-request limits. It is not moderated, allowing broader use. Integration with Transformers/vLLM or agent frameworks is implied but not explicitly detailed. No information on rate limits, regional availability, or open-source download is present beyond the Hugging Face ID (empty).\n\n## Use Cases & Applications\n- **Recommended Applications Based on Performance Data**: Ideal for ultra-low latency tasks requiring fast token generation and high throughput, such as real-time chat agents, quick multimodal processing (e.g., image/text analysis with audio/file support), and cost-sensitive reasoning workflows. Suitable for enabling reasoning selectively in coding, mathematics, or scientific tasks via API parameters. The large 1M+ context makes it apt for long-context retrieval, RAG, or multi-turn conversations with multimodal inputs. Highlights suggest use in agentic workflows, similar to optimized models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 for agents/coding.\n- **Strengths and Limitations**: Strengths include cost efficiency, speed (improved over prior Flash models), multimodal support (text+image+file+audio), and flexible reasoning control for balancing speed/intelligence. Large context (1,048,576 tokens) enables handling extensive inputs. Limitations: Default non-reasoning mode may reduce depth for complex tasks unless enabled (increasing cost); no specific benchmark superiority detailed; audio output not supported (input only); lacks explicit \"thinking\" variants like some Qwen or DeepSeek models. Preview status may imply instability; no moderation could limit safe deployment in sensitive areas. Detailed limitations on audio/file processing or multilingual performance are not present in the datasets.\n\n## Community & Updates\n- **Recent Developments or Updates**: This is a September 2025 preview checkpoint in the Gemini 2.5 family, created on timestamp 1758819686. It builds on earlier Flash models with optimizations for latency, throughput, and reasoning configurability. The OpenRouter Catalogue highlights ongoing advancements in Gemini 2.5 variants, including image support and reasoning parameters. Related updates include the full Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 09-2025. No further release notes or version history beyond the preview label are provided.\n- **User Feedback and Adoption**: No direct user feedback, reviews, or adoption metrics are present in the datasets. The catalogue positions it within a selection of 17 high-end models, suggesting growing interest in efficient multimodal LLMs like Gemini for agentic and coding applications. Community aspects, such as forums or GitHub activity, are not detailed.",

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.\n\nIn internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.\n",

It introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining output quality. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model was trained under conditions aligned with V3.1-Terminus to enable direct comparison. Benchmarking shows performance roughly on par with V3.1 across reasoning, coding, and agentic tool-use tasks, with minor tradeoffs and gains depending on the domain. This release focuses on validating architectural optimizations for extended context lengths rather than advancing raw task accuracy, making it primarily a research-oriented model for exploring efficient transformer designs.",

Read the [docs here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#reasoning-effort-level)\n\nCodex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup.

It is a large hybrid reasoning model (671B parameters, 37B active) that supports both thinking and non-thinking modes. It extends the DeepSeek-V3 base with a two-phase long-context training process, reaching up to 128K tokens, and uses FP8 microscaling for efficient inference. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model improves tool use, code generation, and reasoning efficiency, achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 on difficult benchmarks while responding more quickly. It supports structured tool calling, code agents, and search agents, making it suitable for research, coding, and agentic workflows. ",

It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.",

It supports long-context inference up to 256k tokens, extended from the previous 128k.\n\nThis update improves agentic coding with higher accuracy and better generalization across scaffolds, and enhances frontend coding with more aesthetic and functional outputs for web, 3D, and related tasks. Kimi K2 is optimized for agentic capabilities, including advanced tool use, reasoning, and code synthesis. It excels across coding (LiveCodeBench, SWE-bench), reasoning (ZebraLogic, GPQA), and tool-use (Tau2, AceBench) benchmarks. The model is trained with a novel stack incorporating the MuonClip optimizer for stable large-scale MoE training.",

The model is designed specifically for “thinking mode,” where internal reasoning traces are separated from final answers.\n\nCompared to earlier Qwen3-30B releases, this version improves performance across logical reasoning, mathematics, science, coding, and multilingual benchmarks. It also demonstrates stronger instruction following, tool use, and alignment with human preferences. With higher reasoning efficiency and extended output budgets, it is best suited for advanced research, competitive problem solving, and agentic applications requiring structured long-context reasoning.",
