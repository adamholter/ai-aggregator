- Other benchmarks like AIME and Math_500 are not available (null in data).

Additional benchmark results from web research include:
- 51.3% accuracy on challenging, multi-file refactor scenarios.
- Approximately 74.5% on the Software Engineering (SWE-bench) benchmark.
- Efficiency: Uses 93.7%-94% fewer tokens than GPT-5 for the easiest 10% of tasks.
- For the hardest 10% of tasks, it spends roughly twice as long as GPT-5 on reasoning and iterative testing.

### Comparisons with Similar Models
The provided data includes comparisons primarily with the base GPT-5 model:
- On complex refactoring benchmarks: 51.3% accuracy for GPT-5 Codex (high) vs. 33.9% (or ~34%) for GPT-5, representing a significant improvement.
- On SWE-bench: 74.5% for GPT-5 Codex (high) vs. 74.9% for GPT-5 "thinking" variant, showing near parity but slight underperformance in broad coding skills.
No related models were discovered in the data, so no additional comparisons are available. The model demonstrates gains in accuracy (e.g., +17.4 percentage points on refactoring) and efficiency (token reduction for easier tasks) over GPT-5, while maintaining comparable overall coding performance.
