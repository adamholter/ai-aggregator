- In the broader dataset, it leads the LLMs category in artificial_analysis_intelligence_index (68.5), but smaller models like GPT-5 nano (minimal) achieve faster inference (166.486 tokens/sec vs. 160.038).
- Against non-OpenAI models, it exceeds Llama 3.1 Instruct 405B (intelligence 28.1, math 3) and Gemma 3 12B Instruct (intelligence 20.4, math 18.3) significantly.
- In OpenRouter Catalogue, the base GPT-5 Codex is noted for advanced reasoning and coding, with pricing and context positioning it as a premium option compared to faster models like Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite Preview (738.369 tokens/sec but lower benchmarks).

Overall, it excels in high-stakes reasoning and coding but has slower first-token latency (19.868s) compared to leaders like GPT-5 nano (minimal) at 1.006s.

# Technical Details

Architecture insights are limited in the data; it is described as a specialized version of GPT-5, likely building on transformer-based designs with multimodal support (text + image inputs, text outputs). The tokenizer is "GPT", and instruct type is null, indicating a chat/instruct-tuned model. It features test-time routing for reasoning control (e.g., "think hard" prompts) and integrates with developer environments like CLI, IDEs, GitHub, and cloud tasks.

Input/output specifications:
- **Inputs**: Text, images (for UI development), files; supports 400,000 token context.
- **Outputs**: Text; max completion tokens up to 128,000 (from OpenRouter entry).
- Modality: text+image -> text.
- Supported parameters include include_reasoning, max_tokens, reasoning, response_format, seed, structured_outputs, tool_choice, tools (enabling agentic coding, function calling).
- No explicit details on parameter count, but as a "high" GPT-5 variant, it aligns with large-scale models in the family (e.g., comparable to GPT-5 (high) at similar benchmarks).

Information on exact architecture (e.g., layers, heads) or training details is not present in the provided datasets.

# Pricing & Availability

Pricing structure from the model data is per 1 million tokens: blended 3:1 ratio at **$3.438**, input at **$1.25**, output at **$10**. The OpenRouter Catalogue provides per-token pricing for the base GPT-5 Codex: prompt at **$0.00000125** (equivalent to $1.25 per 1M), completion at **$0.00001** ($10 per 1M), with additional input cache read at $0.000000125 per token. No explicit tiers are mentioned, but it fits premium OpenAI models (e.g., higher than GPT-5 nano at $0.05 input/$0.4 output per 1M).

Availability: Accessible via OpenAI's API and OpenRouter Catalogue (slug: openai/gpt-5-codex). It is moderated (is_moderated: true in OpenRouter), with max completion 128,000 tokens. No free tier or specific access methods beyond standard API calls are detailed. The model is listed in the Artificial Analysis â LLMs dataset and OpenRouter's 31-model catalogue, indicating broad availability for developers post-2025-09-23 release.

No details on rate limits or regional availability are present in the datasets.

# Use Cases & Applications

Based on performance data, recommended applications include **software engineering and coding workflows**: building projects from scratch, feature development, debugging, large-scale refactoring, code review, and multimodal UI tasks (e.g., from screenshots). High scores in coding (53.5 index, 0.84 LiveCodeBench), math (98.7 index, 0.987 AIME_25), and agentic tasks (0.868 Tau2, 0.741 IFBench) suit complex, multi-step problems like autonomous programming, tool calling, and reasoning-heavy development. Strong intelligence (68.5) and MMLU-Pro (0.865) support general research agents, scientific coding (0.409 SciCode), and long-context retrieval (0.69 LCR).

Strengths: Exceptional math/coding prowess (leads category), steerable reasoning for developer control, efficient for extended runs (400K context), and integration with tools/environments.
Limitations: Slower inference (19.868s first token, 160 tokens/sec) compared to lighter models like Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (548-738 tokens/sec); null benchmarks (e.g., AIME, MATH_500) suggest gaps in some math evaluations; higher pricing positions it for high-stakes use over cost-sensitive tasks. Not ideal for ultra-low latency or non-coding general chat.

# Community & Updates

The model was released on **2025-09-23**, as part of OpenAI's GPT-5 ecosystem expansions noted in the LLMs category summary (e.g., alongside GPT-5 Pro in OpenRouter). No specific recent developments, user feedback, or adoption metrics are present in the provided datasets. The OpenRouter description highlights its optimization for interactive development and independent task execution, implying community focus on developer tools, but no explicit mentions of updates, forums, or reviews.

It integrates enhanced multimodal alignment and long-context processing (native 256K, expandable to 1M tokens) for tasks such as scientific visual analysis, causal inference, and mathematical reasoning over image or video inputs.\n\nCompared to the Instruct edition, the Thinking version introduces deeper visual-language fusion and deliberate reasoning pathways that improve performance on long-chain logic tasks, STEM problem-solving, and multi-step video understanding. It achieves stronger temporal grounding via Interleaved-MRoPE and timestamp-aware embeddings, while maintaining robust OCR, multilingual comprehension, and text generation on par with large text-only LLMs.",

It represents the first flagship non-thinking model in the Ling 2.0 series, built around a sparse-activation architecture with roughly 50 billion active parameters per token. The model supports up to 128 K tokens of context and emphasizes efficient reasoning through an “Evolutionary Chain-of-Thought (Evo-CoT)” training strategy.\n\nPre-trained on more than 20 trillion reasoning-dense tokens, Ling-1T achieves strong results across code generation, mathematics, and logical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency. It employs FP8 mixed-precision training, MoE routing with QK normalization, and MTP layers for compositional reasoning stability. The model also introduces LPO (Linguistics-unit Policy Optimization) for post-training alignment, enhancing sentence-level semantic control.\n\nLing-1T can perform complex text generation, multilingual reasoning, and front-end code synthesis with a focus on both functionality and aesthetics.",

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.\n\nIn internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.\n",

        "description": "DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp is an experimental large language model released by DeepSeek as an intermediate step between V3.1 and future architectures. It introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining output quality. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model was trained under conditions aligned with V3.1-Terminus to enable direct comparison. Benchmarking shows performance roughly on par with V3.1 across reasoning, coding, and agentic tool-use tasks, with minor tradeoffs and gains depending on the domain. This release focuses on validating architectural optimizations for extended context lengths rather than advancing raw task accuracy, making it primarily a research-oriented model for exploring efficient transformer designs.",

It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup.

Compared with prior Qwen3 variants, it emphasizes stability under long chains of thought and efficient scaling during inference, and it is tuned to follow complex instructions while reducing repetitive or off-task behavior.\n\nThe model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required. It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.",

        "description": "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct is an instruction-tuned chat model in the Qwen3-Next series optimized for fast, stable responses without “thinking” traces. It targets complex tasks across reasoning, code generation, knowledge QA, and multilingual use, while remaining robust on alignment and formatting. Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.\n\nThe model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.",

It supports long-context inference up to 256k tokens, extended from the previous 128k.\n\nThis update improves agentic coding with higher accuracy and better generalization across scaffolds, and enhances frontend coding with more aesthetic and functional outputs for web, 3D, and related tasks. Kimi K2 is optimized for agentic capabilities, including advanced tool use, reasoning, and code synthesis. It excels across coding (LiveCodeBench, SWE-bench), reasoning (ZebraLogic, GPQA), and tool-use (Tau2, AceBench) benchmarks. The model is trained with a novel stack incorporating the MuonClip optimizer for stable large-scale MoE training.",
