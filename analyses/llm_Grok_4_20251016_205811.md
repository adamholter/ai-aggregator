## Model Overview

Grok 4 is a large language model developed by xAI, as indicated in the model database entry. It falls under the category of advanced LLMs, similar to those evaluated in the Artificial Analysis â LLMs dataset, which focuses on high-performance models from providers like OpenAI and xAI. Key specifications include a release date of July 10, 2025, and strong performance in reasoning-intensive benchmarks. The model supports multimodal capabilities, as evidenced by references to "Grok 4 Fast" in the OpenRouter Catalogue, described as xAI's latest multimodal model with state-of-the-art cost-efficiency and a 2,000,000-token context window. It offers two modes: non-reasoning for direct responses and reasoning for enhanced intelligence, controllable via API parameters like `reasoning.enabled`. Median output tokens per second is 40.55, with a median time to first token of 13.63 seconds, suggesting moderate inference speed suitable for balanced workloads.

## Performance Analysis

Grok 4 demonstrates exceptional performance in mathematics and reasoning benchmarks from the provided evaluations. It achieves near-perfect scores on math_500 (0.99), aime (0.943), and aime_25 (0.927), indicating superior capability in advanced mathematical problem-solving. The artificial_analysis_math_index is 92.7, one of the highest in the dataset, closely rivaling top OpenAI models like GPT-5 (high) at 94.3 and gpt-oss-120B (high) at 93.4. In general intelligence, the artificial_analysis_intelligence_index scores 65.3, competitive with GPT-5 (medium) at 66.4 but below GPT-5 (high) at 68.5. Coding performance is solid with artificial_analysis_coding_index at 55.1, livecodebench at 0.819, and scicode at 0.457, outperforming models like Llama 3.3 Instruct 70B (coding_index 19.2, livecodebench 0.288) but trailing specialized ones like GPT-5 Codex (high) at 53.5 coding_index.

Other notable scores include mmlu_pro at 0.866 (strong knowledge and reasoning), gpqa at 0.877 (graduate-level questions), and tau2 at 0.749 (tool use). Weaker areas include hle at 0.239 (human-level evaluation) and terminalbench_hard at 0.376 (terminal-based tasks), which are lower than top performers like GPT-5 (high) at hle 0.265. Compared to the OpenRouter Catalogue, Grok 4 Fast's emphasis on efficiency aligns with high-throughput models like Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (up to 713 tokens/second output), but specific benchmark comparisons are limited to the LLMs dataset, where Grok 4 positions as a top contender in math and intelligence indices among xAI models (e.g., outperforming older Grok-1, which lacks evaluation data).

## Technical Details

Architecture details are not explicitly provided in the datasets for Grok 4, but the OpenRouter entry for Grok 4 Fast describes it as a multimodal model (text+image input to text output) with a tokenizer labeled "Grok" and support for instruct-type interactions. It features a massive 2,000,000-token context length, the largest in the OpenRouter Catalogue, enabling extended conversations and long-context tasks. Input modalities include text and images, with output limited to text; it supports parameters like temperature, top_p, max_tokens, reasoning control, structured_outputs, and tools for agentic workflows. No specific parameter counts or training details (e.g., MoE or dense) are available, though its efficiency suggests optimizations for high context handling. Median latency metrics (13.63 seconds to first token, 40.55 tokens/second output) indicate it's not the fastest (e.g., compared to GPT-5 mini (high) at 91.992 tokens/second), but suitable for reasoning-heavy applications.

## Pricing & Availability

Pricing for Grok 4 is structured at $3 per 1M input tokens, $15 per 1M output tokens, and $6 per 1M blended (3:1 input-output ratio), positioning it as a premium model in the LLMs dataset, higher than efficient variants like gpt-oss-20B (high) at $0.094 blended but comparable to GPT-5 (high) at $3.438 blended. In the OpenRouter Catalogue, the related Grok 4 Fast is highly affordable at $0.0000002 per input token and $0.0000005 per output token (or free on certain tiers with data usage for improvement), including $0.00000005 for input cache reads, making it one of the most cost-effective large-context options alongside free models like Tongyi DeepResearch 30B A3B. Availability is through xAI's API and OpenRouter, with the catalogue noting max completion tokens up to 30,000 and no per-request limits specified. It is moderated (is_moderated: false in OpenRouter), and prompts/completions may be used for model improvement on free tiers.

## Use Cases & Applications

Based on its high math (92.7 index, 0.99 on math_500) and reasoning scores (gpqa 0.877, mmlu_pro 0.866), Grok 4 is recommended for STEM applications, advanced problem-solving, and agentic workflows involving tool use (tau2 0.749, ifbench 0.537). The 2M context length from Grok 4 Fast supports long-document analysis, multi-turn research agents, and multimodal tasks like image-based reasoning. Coding use cases (livecodebench 0.819) suit software development and debugging, though lower scicode (0.457) and terminalbench_hard (0.376) suggest limitations in specialized scientific coding or terminal interactions. Strengths include cost-efficient long-context handling and reasoning modes for complex queries, outperforming smaller models like Llama 3.1 Instruct 405B (intelligence_index 28.1). Limitations: Higher latency (13.63s to first token) may hinder real-time apps, and lower hle (0.239) indicates gaps in human-like evaluation; no explicit multimodal output beyond text is noted.

## Community & Updates

The datasets do not provide direct user feedback, adoption metrics, or community discussions for Grok 4. Recent developments include its July 10, 2025 release, with the OpenRouter Catalogue highlighting Grok 4 Fast as xAI's latest multimodal update emphasizing SOTA cost-efficiency and reasoning modes, released around the same period (created timestamp implies late 2025 integration). The LLMs dataset includes older xAI models like Grok-1 (2024-03-17, no evaluations), suggesting Grok 4 represents a significant upgrade. Broader trends in the Structured Dataset Summary note xAI's focus on massive context windows (2M tokens), positioning it as a leader in deployment trends alongside Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 (1M tokens). No specific updates post-release or community notes are present in the data.

It represents the first flagship non-thinking model in the Ling 2.0 series, built around a sparse-activation architecture with roughly 50 billion active parameters per token. The model supports up to 128 K tokens of context and emphasizes efficient reasoning through an “Evolutionary Chain-of-Thought (Evo-CoT)” training strategy.\n\nPre-trained on more than 20 trillion reasoning-dense tokens, Ling-1T achieves strong results across code generation, mathematics, and logical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency. It employs FP8 mixed-precision training, MoE routing with QK normalization, and MTP layers for compositional reasoning stability. The model also introduces LPO (Linguistics-unit Policy Optimization) for post-training alignment, enhancing sentence-level semantic control.\n\nLing-1T can perform complex text generation, multilingual reasoning, and front-end code synthesis with a focus on both functionality and aesthetics.",

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.\n\nIn internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.\n",

It introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining output quality. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model was trained under conditions aligned with V3.1-Terminus to enable direct comparison. Benchmarking shows performance roughly on par with V3.1 across reasoning, coding, and agentic tool-use tasks, with minor tradeoffs and gains depending on the domain. This release focuses on validating architectural optimizations for extended context lengths rather than advancing raw task accuracy, making it primarily a research-oriented model for exploring efficient transformer designs.",

        "description": "GPT-5-Codex is a specialized version of GPT-5 optimized for software engineering and coding workflows. It is designed for both interactive development sessions and long, independent execution of complex engineering tasks. The model supports building projects from scratch, feature development, debugging, large-scale refactoring, and code review. Compared to GPT-5, Codex is more steerable, adheres closely to developer instructions, and produces cleaner, higher-quality code outputs. Reasoning effort can be adjusted with the `reasoning.effort` parameter. Read the [docs here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#reasoning-effort-level)\n\nCodex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup. Codex is intended specifically for agentic coding applications.",

It is a large hybrid reasoning model (671B parameters, 37B active) that supports both thinking and non-thinking modes. It extends the DeepSeek-V3 base with a two-phase long-context training process, reaching up to 128K tokens, and uses FP8 microscaling for efficient inference. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model improves tool use, code generation, and reasoning efficiency, achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 on difficult benchmarks while responding more quickly.

Compared with prior Qwen3 variants, it emphasizes stability under long chains of thought and efficient scaling during inference, and it is tuned to follow complex instructions while reducing repetitive or off-task behavior.\n\nThe model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required. It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.",

The model is designed specifically for “thinking mode,” where internal reasoning traces are separated from final answers.\n\nCompared to earlier Qwen3-30B releases, this version improves performance across logical reasoning, mathematics, science, coding, and multilingual benchmarks. It also demonstrates stronger instruction following, tool use, and alignment with human preferences. With higher reasoning efficiency and extended output budgets, it is best suited for advanced research, competitive problem solving, and agentic applications requiring structured long-context reasoning.",

It introduces the same hybrid mode as the larger 405B release, allowing the model to either respond directly or generate explicit <think>...</think> reasoning traces before answering. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThis 70B variant is trained with the expanded post-training corpus (~60B tokens) emphasizing verified reasoning data, leading to improvements in mathematics, coding, STEM, logic, and structured outputs while maintaining general assistant performance. It supports JSON mode, schema adherence, function calling, and tool use, and is designed for greater steerability with reduced refusal rates.",
